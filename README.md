# FPGA Timing Benchmarks

The scripts require some CAD tools in order to run and test the benchmarks. We
will be using the SiliconCompiler project to manage the tools and versions.
The following commands should install the correct versions of the tools that this
project requires.
```
# Optional: Create a python virtual enviornment.
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install this directory as a Python module.
pip install .

# Install siliconcompiler
pip install --upgrade siliconcompiler

# Install necessary tools using SiliconCompiler (these should update your PATH).
sc-install yosys-wildebeest opensta vpr
```

For the tests in this benchmark, we will run them on Zero ASIC's z1010 architecture.
The choice of architecture was somewhat arbitrary; however, we do need an architecture
that has the necessary liberty files which can be used for post-implementation
timing analysis. This architecture is also built-into Wildebeest right now,
so it is slightly more convenient.
The following commands will download the latest release of the z1010 architecture
and untar it into this directory.
```
wget https://github.com/siliconcompiler/logiklib/releases/download/v0.2.0/z1010_cad.tar.gz
tar -xvzf z1010_cad.tar.gz
```
